# Git & GitHub Notes

This repository contains my personal notes on **Git and GitHub**.

The notes are written in a **simple and beginner-friendly** way to help understand:
- Git basics and workflows
- Branching and merging
- Diff, stash, and tags
- Managing Git history
- GitHub basics and remote repositories

These notes are mainly for **learning and quick reference**.

Feel free to explore, use, and revise them for your own understanding.
